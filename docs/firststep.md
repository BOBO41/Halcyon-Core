## Now What?

You’ve just completed the 5 Minute Installation of Halcyon Core CMS or one-click install from your web host. Now what?

Let’s take a step-by-step tour through your Halcyon Core CMS site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own.

## Log In

Begin by logging into the “administration area” or the back end of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing “portal” after your domain name (e.g. http://example.com/en-us/portal). Now log into Halcyon Core CMS using your username and password.

## Start at the Top

After logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard. This is the brain behind your website, the place where you can let your creativity explode, writing brilliant prose and designing the best and most lovely website possible. This is where the organization of your site begins – and this is just the start.
